Linear Programming Problem Solver Project Overview
This project is designed to tackle a variety of Linear Programming (LP) challenges using Python. The aim is to optimize outcomes such as maximizing profits or minimizing expenses, all while adhering to specific constraints like resource limitations. These problems are solved using Python's scipy library, with some incorporating graphical representations.

Goal
The main goal of this project is to:

Optimize a target function (e.g., maximize profit or minimize cost) under given constraints.
Address real-life LP scenarios such as resource distribution, production scheduling, and cost reduction.
Problems Addressed
Profit Maximization for a Factory
Cost Minimization for a Manufacturer
Production Maximization with Limited Resources
Revenue Maximization from Sales
Resource Allocation Between Two Projects
Production Planning for a Bakery
Cost Minimization for a Transportation Company
Revenue Maximization from Multiple Products
Budget Allocation for an Advertising Campaign
Meal Planning Optimization for a School Cafeteria
