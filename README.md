Linear Programming Problem Solver Project Overview
This project is designed to tackle a variety of Linear Programming (LP) challenges using Python. The aim is to optimize outcomes such as maximizing profits or minimizing expenses, all while adhering to specific constraints like resource limitations. These problems are solved using Python's scipy library, with some incorporating graphical representations.

Goal
The main goal of this project is to:

Optimize a target function (e.g., maximize profit or minimize cost) under given constraints.

Problems Addressed
1. Profit Maximization for a Factory
2. Cost Minimization for a Manufacturer
3. Production Maximization with Limited Resources
4. Revenue Maximization from Sales
5. Resource Allocation Between Two Projects
6. Production Planning for a Bakery
7. Cost Minimization for a Transportation Company
8. Revenue Maximization from Multiple Products
9. Budget Allocation for an Advertising Campaign
10. Meal Planning Optimization for a School Cafeteria
    
How to Execute the Code
1. Download the repository to your local system.
2. Install the required Python libraries via the requirements file or manually.
3. Open and execute the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to solve the LP problems.
   
Requirements
1.Python 3.x
